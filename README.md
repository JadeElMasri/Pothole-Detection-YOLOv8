This repository represents a trained YOLOv8 object detection model on an Ubuntu 22 Core i9 PC

The model uses **Ultralytics YOLOv8**

(ultralytics_yolo.png)




and was trained using on a custom dataset from Roboflow (https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/pothole) + manually added background-only samples.   

The outcome of this project could be useful in a diversity of resrearch or engineering fields such as Autonomous Vehicles, Smart City Initiatives, Traffic Monitoring etc...





**Results**


### ðŸ“Š Confusion Matrix

![Confusion Matrix](runs/detect/train2/confusion_matrix_normalized.png)




The model correctly predicted **77%** of the potholes while **23%**  were predicted as background. 

In addition to that, **100%** of the background was predicted as potholes. This proves the limitations exhibitted by the model




**Limitations**:
  The trained dataset had numerous pothole images with very limited clean road images. This explains the wrong predictions and the biasness of the model.


**Future Work**
  
  Add more clean road imges to imorove the model's robustness and predictions.
